# modified-PONG-GAME
A modified Version of Pong Where the paddles rotate using the Pygame library to get a feeling for the package. Currently Unfinished due to some collision detection and ball redirection errors. 

Plan to add a pause menu as well as a settings menu to configure the score ball speed,  paddle rotation speed as well as other aethestic features of the game.
